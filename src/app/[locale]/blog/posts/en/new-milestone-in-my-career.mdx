Microservices architecture has become increasingly popular for its ability to break down large, monolithic applications into smaller, more manageable, and independently deployable services. In this post, we'll explore how to build microservices using Node.js, covering the basics of microservices, the benefits of using Node.js, and providing a simple code template to get you started.

## What are Microservices?

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain. Each microservice is:

- **Independently deployable**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Loosely coupled**: Services interact with each other using well-defined APIs, reducing dependencies.
- **Organized around business capabilities**: Each service is built around a specific business function.

## Why Use Node.js for Microservices?

Node.js is a popular choice for building microservices due to its:

- **Asynchronous nature**: Node.js is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests.
- **Lightweight**: Node.js applications are typically lightweight and have a smaller memory footprint.
- **Rich ecosystem**: With npm, Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can accelerate development.

## Setting Up the Project

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.
