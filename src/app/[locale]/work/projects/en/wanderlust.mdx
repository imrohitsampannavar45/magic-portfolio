## Overview

In this project, I developed Wanderlust, a travel booking platform using ReactJS for the frontend and Tailwind CSS for styling. The goal was to create an intuitive and responsive web application that enables users to search for destinations, book flights and accommodations, and explore travel packages.

## Key Features

- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for travel destinations and filter results based on preferences such as budget, travel dates, and type of accommodation.
- **Booking System**: Integrated a booking system that allows users to book flights and accommodations directly through the platform.
- **Travel Packages**: Featured curated travel packages that include multiple services and activities.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured a seamless experience across various devices using Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface and handling state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with a utility-first approach.
- **API Integration**: Integrated various travel APIs to fetch real-time data for flights and accommodations.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was integrating multiple APIs to fetch real-time travel data while ensuring the platform remains responsive and user-friendly. Additionally, designing a visually appealing and functional user interface that caters to a broad audience was a significant learning experience.

## Outcome

Wanderlust is now a fully functional travel booking platform that provides users with an easy and efficient way to plan their trips. The project improved my skills in ReactJS, API integration, and responsive design, and laid the foundation for future enhancements and features.
